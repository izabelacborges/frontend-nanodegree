# Animal Card

This is the second project on the Front-End Nanodegree, it's a two-part project.

- The first part is a HTML file with info on Salem, Sabrina's cat.
- The second part is a CSS file with style for the cute card I made.

There is a prototype for this project, referenced on the [design-prototype.png](https://github.com/izabelacborges/frontend-nanodegree/blob/master/animal-card/design-prototype.png) file. And I added a image for the final product of my project and you can find it in [final-product.png](https://github.com/izabelacborges/frontend-nanodegree/blob/master/animal-card/final-product.png).
