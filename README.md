# Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree

Hello, this is a repo for all my Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree projects. As completing them I'll put hyperlinks for them here on this README file.

So, to this date I completed the projects below:
- [Developer Mindset Markdown](https://github.com/izabelacborges/frontend-nanodegree/blob/master/MINDSET.md)
- [Article Mockup](https://github.com/izabelacborges/frontend-nanodegree/blob/master/article-mockup/)
